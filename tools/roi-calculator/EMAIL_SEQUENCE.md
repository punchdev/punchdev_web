## Email 1: Immediate Delivery (0 minutes)

**Subject**: Your ROI Report: ${SAVINGS} in Potential Savings

**From**: Georges Duplessy <georges@punchdev.net>

**Preview Text**: Here's your personalized analysis comparing SDR costs vs AI lead generation

**Body**:

```
Hi ${FIRST_NAME},

Thanks for using our ROI calculator! I've attached your personalized report showing how AI-powered lead generation could save you ${SAVINGS} annually.

Here's what you'll find inside:

✓ Complete cost breakdown (SDR team vs AI)
✓ 3-year projection and break-even analysis
✓ Personalized recommendations for your situation
✓ Implementation timeline and next steps

A few key findings from your analysis:

• You'd need ${SDR_COUNT} SDRs to hit ${MEETING_GOAL} meetings/month
• That costs ${SDR_COST}/year with traditional hiring
• AI lead generation achieves the same output for ${AI_COST}/year
• **Net savings: ${SAVINGS}/year (${SAVINGS_PERCENT}% reduction)**

The numbers speak for themselves.

Quick question: What surprised you most about the cost difference?

I'm curious because many B2B SaaS leaders don't realize how quickly SDR costs compound when you factor in ramp time, turnover, and management overhead.

If you want to discuss how these numbers apply to your specific situation, I'm happy to jump on a quick call. No pressure—I just find these conversations helpful for understanding what matters most to companies at your stage.

## Email 2: Case Study (Day 2)

**Subject**: How ${COMPANY_NAME} Cut Outbound Costs by 78%

**Preview Text**: Real results from a B2B SaaS company that made the switch

**Body**:

```
Hi ${FIRST_NAME},

After sending you the ROI calculator results, I thought you might want to see how these projections play out in the real world.

I just published a case study about how [Company Name], a Series A SaaS company, switched from a 4-person SDR team to AI-powered lead generation.

**Their situation (sounds familiar?):**
- Burning $280K/year on SDRs
- Inconsistent results month-to-month
- High turnover (lost 2 SDRs in 6 months)
- Couldn't scale without blowing out budget

**What they did:**
- Replaced 3 SDRs with AI lead generation
- Kept their best SDR for high-touch accounts
- Implemented over 2 weeks (vs. 3-month hiring cycle)

**Results after 90 days:**
- 22 qualified meetings/month (up from 18)
- $217K annual cost savings
- Zero ramp time or turnover issues
- Payback period: < 30 days

[Read the Full Case Study]

The numbers in your calculator (${SAVINGS} in savings) aren't hypothetical—this is what's actually happening when B2B SaaS companies make the switch.

Want to talk about how this could work for your team?

Best,
Georges

P.S. - The most common objection I hear is "But AI can't replace the human touch." The case study addresses exactly how they handled personalization at scale.
```

**Segment-Specific Variations**:

- **"Scale pipeline" goal**: Focus on growth without headcount
- **"Reduce costs" goal**: Emphasize $217K savings
- **"Replace SDR team" goal**: Highlight hybrid approach (kept best SDR)
- **"Just exploring" goal**: Educational tone, no hard sell

## Email 3: Objection Handling (Day 5)

**Subject**: "But can AI really replace our SDR team?" (Answered)

**Preview Text**: The 5 most common concerns about AI lead generation—addressed honestly

**Body**:

```
Hi ${FIRST_NAME},

I've shared that ROI calculator with hundreds of B2B SaaS companies, and I always get the same questions:

**1. "Can AI really write personalized emails?"**

Short answer: Yes, but not how you think.

AI doesn't write generic templates. It researches each prospect (funding, hiring, tech stack, recent news) and crafts unique emails based on that context—just like your best SDR would, but at 100x the speed.

**2. "What about reply handling? We need humans for that."**

AI handles 80% of replies automatically:
- "Not interested" → Remove from sequence
- "Tell me more" → Book meeting
- "Not right now" → Follow up in 3 months
- Complex questions → Escalate to you

You only see the qualified conversations.

**3. "Our ICP is too complex for AI."**

I hear this a lot. Then I show them how AI can:
- Target by 20+ firmographic criteria
- Filter by intent signals (hiring, funding, tech stack)
- Personalize by role, industry, company stage
- Adapt messaging based on responses

It's actually *better* at complex targeting than manual research.

**4. "What if it damages our brand?"**

Valid concern. That's why we:
- Review all email templates before launch
- Monitor reply sentiment daily
- Give you full control over messaging
- Never send without your approval

Your brand stays in your hands.

**5. "This sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?"**

The catch: AI works best for *volume* prospecting.

If you only need 5 meetings/month and want white-glove, fully custom outreach for each prospect, hire a senior SDR.

But if you need ${MEETING_GOAL} meetings/month at a predictable cost? That's where AI shines.

Still have questions? Let's talk through your specific concerns.

[Book a 15-Min Call]

Best,
Georges

P.S. - I'm not here to sell you on AI if it's not the right fit. But I do want you to make an informed decision—not one based on outdated assumptions about what AI can do in 2026.

## Email 4: Implementation Guide (Day 7)

**Subject**: What the First 30 Days Look Like

**Preview Text**: Step-by-step: How to go from decision to first meetings in under a month

**Body**:

```
Hi ${FIRST_NAME},

You've seen the numbers (${SAVINGS} in potential savings).
You've seen the case study (real results from a similar company).
You've got answers to the common objections.

Now let's talk about what implementation actually looks like.

**Week 1: Setup & Strategy**
- Kick-off call to define your ICP
- Integrate with your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
- Set up email infrastructure and tracking
- Review and approve messaging templates

**Week 2: Launch & Monitoring**
- Begin outreach to first 500 prospects
- Daily monitoring and optimization
- Handle early replies and feedback
- A/B test subject lines and messaging

**Week 3-4: Scale & Optimize**
- Scale to full volume (${MEETING_GOAL} meetings/month target)
- Qualify and book meetings
- Analyze what's working, iterate on what's not
- Monthly reporting and strategy sessions

**By Day 30, you'll have:**
- ${MEETING_GOAL} qualified meetings booked (or we keep working until you do)
- Clear data on what messaging resonates
- Optimized ICP based on actual response rates
- Predictable pipeline you can forecast against

Compare that to hiring SDRs:
- Week 1-4: Job posting and screening
- Week 5-8: Interviews and offers
- Week 9-12: Onboarding and training
- Month 4-6: Ramp to productivity (maybe)

With AI, you're getting meetings in the time it takes just to *hire* an SDR.

Want to see how this would work for your team?

[Book Your Strategy Call]

On the call, we'll:
- Review your current outbound process
- Identify quick wins and opportunities
- Map out a custom implementation plan
- Show you exactly what to expect in the first 30 days

No pressure, no long sales pitch. Just a practical conversation about whether this makes sense for your situation.

Best,
Georges

P.S. - One founder told me: "I wish I'd done this 6 months ago. We wasted $120K hiring SDRs who never ramped before they left." Don't wait until you've burned your budget to explore better options.
```

## Email 5: Final Invitation (Day 10)

**Subject**: Following up on your ROI analysis

**Preview Text**: Quick question about your ${MEETING_GOAL} meetings/month goal

**Body**:

```
Hi ${FIRST_NAME},

I wanted to follow up one last time about your ROI calculator results.

Quick recap:
- You're targeting ${MEETING_GOAL} qualified meetings/month
- Traditional SDRs would cost you ${SDR_COST}/year
- AI lead generation achieves this for ${AI_COST}/year
- **Potential savings: ${SAVINGS}/year**

I'm curious—have you made any decisions about how you'll scale your outbound?

If you're:
✓ Still evaluating options
✓ Curious how this would work for your ICP
✓ Wondering if AI can handle your industry
✓ Wanting to see examples specific to your space

...I'm happy to jump on a quick call and walk through it.

[Book a 15-Min Strategy Call]

No obligation. Just a practical conversation about what makes sense for your situation.

And if you've already found another solution or decided this isn't the right time—totally fine. Just reply and let me know so I don't keep bugging you.

Best,
Georges

P.S. - The companies that move fastest on this typically fall into two camps:

1. **"We're hiring SDRs right now"** → They see the cost comparison and pause hiring to evaluate AI first
2. **"We can't afford to hire SDRs"** → They see AI as the only way to scale without blowing budget

Which camp are you in?

## Email Copywriting Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- Use specific numbers from their calculator results
- Keep emails under 250 words (except Email 3)
- One clear CTA per email
- Write from Georges personally (not "punchDev team")
- Ask questions to encourage replies
- Acknowledge their specific goal/situation

### Don'ts ❌
- Generic "nurture" content
- Multiple CTAs fighting for attention
- Overly formal language
- Aggressive sales pressure
- Ignore their calculator inputs
- Send same email to everyone regardless of segment

---

## Success Stories to Track

Create mini case studies from:
1. First 3 customers from calculator
2. Highest savings example
3. Fastest implementation
4. Most meetings booked
5. Hybrid approach (AI + human SDRs)

Use in future Email 2 variations.

---

## Integration with CRM

**Salesforce/HubSpot Integration**:
1. Create lead source = "ROI Calculator"
2. Capture calculator inputs as custom fields
3. Score leads based on:
   - Savings amount (higher = better)
   - Meeting goal (15+ = better)
   - Goal selected (scale/replace = better)
   - Email engagement (clicks, replies)
4. Auto-create task for sales team if high-intent

**Lead Scoring Example**:
- Calculator use: +10 points
- Savings >$100K: +20 points
- Meetings goal >20: +15 points
- Email open: +2 points
- Email click: +5 points
- Email reply: +10 points
- Booked call: +50 points (move to SQL)

## FAQ for Internal Use

**Q: What if they don't open Email 1?**
A: Resend after 3 days with new subject line: "Did you get your ROI report?"

**Q: What if they reply with questions?**
A: Stop automated sequence, respond personally within 4 hours, try to book call

**Q: What if they ask for custom pricing?**
